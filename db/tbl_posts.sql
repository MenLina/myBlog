In this article we will discuss the hardness of some materials and interesting results that are obtained based on these properties.

In 1994, a large earthquake struck near Los Angeles, killing 57 people and injuring more than 5,000. Property damage reached an incredible $20 billion. Earthquakes like these make us think. How solid is the ground beneath our feet? What does the concept of hardness even mean?

Coal tar pitch appears hard, but it is not. In fact, it is a very viscous liquid, i.e. it''s liquid. Viscosity is a measure of resistance to spreading. Olive oil is about 100 times more viscous than water, and honey is 100 times more viscous than oil. The viscosity of pitch is 230 billion times greater than the viscosity of water. The world''s longest running experiment on pitch is being conducted at Cleveland University. In 1927, the pitch was placed in a funnel. In 90 years, only 9 drops fell from it. No one was present when the drop fell. In 1988, the experiment''s keeper, John Mainstone, came close to seeing a drop fall. He left the room to pour himself some tea and missed the cherished moment. You can watch this experiment online, but since the last straw fell in 2014, it is unlikely that you will be able to see the coveted fall in the coming years.

Another substance that is a viscous liquid is glass. Glass is unusual in that it is an amorphous solid. Silicon dioxide molecules do not form an ordered structure. Glass cools so quickly that when it transitions from a liquid to a “solid” state, the molecules do not have time to arrange themselves into an ordered crystalline structure. What makes glass visually hard are atoms or molecules that are so chemically bonded to each other that they cannot slide past others.

However, the lack of an ordered crystalline structure makes glass still liquid, even when it is in a visually solid state. It is precisely because glass is actually liquid that in window frames in old houses, where the windows have stood for several decades, it is clearly noticeable that the glass is thinner at the top than at the bottom. This is due to the fact that some of the glass has already been glassed from top to bottom over the years. Therefore, in such houses, the windows rattle in their frames, because at the top they are already thinner than the gap prepared for them. Sometimes this effect is so noticeable that a gap even forms on top.

Go ahead. What do we know about the interior of the Earth? Beneath the earth''s crust is the mantle, which is responsible for the movement of tectonic plates and earthquakes. Is it solid or liquid? We will never be able to see the mantle directly, but we can observe lava, which is hot rock. One can imagine that the mantle is very similar to it. The mantle must be liquid because it needs to flow, right? Actually no, because the mantle is a solid. Earthquake propulsion waves can propagate through the mantle, but these waves cannot travel through liquids, which confirms its solidity. How does a solid stone flow? The answer lies in the imperfection of crystals, which may be missing a few atoms. The viscosity of the mantle is similar to the viscosity of glass, only several orders of magnitude higher. The mantle becomes liquid-like, but only during geological periods of time. Pitch is a liquid that can flow so slowly that it appears to be a solid. And the earth''s mantle is a solid that behaves like a liquid if you wait long enough.

Hardness and ductility do not have an absolute meaning, but only a relative one. And all bodies are actually both liquid and solid. When there is enormous mass and strength involved, the difference loses its meaning. The rigid definitions we create for ourselves lead to misconceptions and sticky rumors.', 'Published', 5, '1699957574.jpg', '2023-11-14 10:26:14', '2023-11-14 10:26:14', 'Something smart');
INSERT INTO tbl_posts (id, title, content, status, author_id, image, created_at, updated_at, tag) VALUES (65, 'How to see the back of your head using a black hole? Interesting Facts', 'In this article, we will briefly consider the properties of black holes that arise as a result of their colossal gravitational attraction, and how interesting these properties “could” be used to solve some everyday problems.

So, a black hole is a region in space-time, the gravitational attraction of which is so strong that even objects moving at the speed of light, including quanta of light itself, cannot leave it, i.e. photons. Typically, supermassive neutron stars create such a strong gravitational pull.

It is precisely because these objects attract and “do not let go” even light that they are called black holes. The light does not leave them at all, is not reflected from them and is not emitted by them in any way, the light is only attracted and “sucked in” by them. This means that such objects cannot be seen. They can only be distinguished against the background of something luminous, and in this case they will look exactly like a black hole.

It is also obvious that objects located relatively far from a black hole are not attracted to it so strongly as to be absorbed. Including light, flying at a certain respectful distance from a black hole, only changes its direction, but still is not “sucked in” by it.

Thus, there are two regions of space relative to each black hole:

the region in which light can fly past a black hole (this is almost the entire space);
and a small region by cosmic standards next to the black hole, inside which light will be absorbed by the black hole and will never be able to fly out.
Since there are two such mutually exclusive regions, it means there is a boundary between them (it is called the event horizon). Light caught at this boundary and moving in the right direction can enter orbit around the black hole. That is, it will not be “sucked in” by the black hole, and yet it will no longer be able to move away from it, but instead will forever rotate in orbit around the black hole. This will be the borderline state between “fly by” and “be absorbed.”

You can come up with a very interesting “application” for this effect, already announced in the title of the article. The fact is that if a person were on this border, he would be able to see the back of his head without using any other means or instruments other than his own eyes. After all, the light reflected from the back of his head, having flown a full circle in orbit around the black hole, would again return exactly to the person’s eye.

However, this way to see the back of your head is not the best. After all, according to modern concepts, it is impossible to accelerate a person to the speed of light, i.e. he will no longer be able to enter orbit around a black hole in this region of space, which means he will only have to fall there. And an object that falls inside the event horizon will probably end up in a singularity, and before that will be torn apart due to the high gradient of the black hole''s gravitational force (tidal forces).

Therefore, in order to find out what the back of your head looks like, it is better to use proven methods: two mirrors or a camera.', 'Published', 5, '1699957663.jpg', '2023-11-14 10:27:43', '2023-11-14 10:27:43', 'Something smart');

The authors refute the idea that during the postwar years, all children equally regarded the period as sombre, as much depended not only on the social status of the children in the local community but also on the political situation in the country. The authors single out obstacles the children whose parents had been repressed were facing, especially in the educational sphere. They describe the atmosphere of suspicion they lived in. Additionally, the authors pay attention to the children’s mental state, as their parents were deprived of their rights, and demonstrate that they experienced a constant lack of comfort, because society was prejudiced against them as “enemies of the people”.', 'Published', 5, '1699957917.png', '2023-11-14 10:31:57', '2023-11-14 10:31:57', 'Life');

Hrum-hum!
What? Yes, yes, now you can go back to sleep.
Crum-crunch-crunch!
Why say thank you? I barely got through, almost died of hunger, and hadn’t eaten since the evening. Lost weight, yeah.
Okay, now get some sleep.
Wow, good, soft, comfortable. Oh, why are you kicking me?
What do you mean, go to your place? It''s warmer here, I won''t go. They warmed up my bed, but should I go to a cold bed?
Yes, I’ll lie here on the edge. Well, okay, okay, I’m leaving... But it’s nothing like a bed.

Well, it''s evening. I am full of strength and energy! What should I do?
Meow? Meow? Meow?
I don’t take anything out, I ask where my rope is, or a ball in case of emergency. Well, or at least stroke it.
Frrrrrr... Oh yes! So nice. Frrrr...
Also, scratch behind your ear here. Frrr! Frrr!
Kus! Oh.
It''s me from an excess of feelings, don''t pay attention.
Frrrr! Piece-bite!

Eh, I complained to him... He scolded me and spanked my beautiful ass.
It doesn''t hurt, but it stings. I''ll go to the closet and mourn.
